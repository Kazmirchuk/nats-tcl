To run the TLS tests, you need to put your own TLS certificates in this folder:
- rootCA.pem
- client-cert.pem
- client-key.pem
- server-cert.pem
- server-key.pem

E.g. you can generate them using [mkcert](https://docs.nats.io/nats-server/configuration/securing_nats/tls#self-signed-certificates-for-testing).
